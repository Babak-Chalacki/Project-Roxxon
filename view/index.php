        <h3>A Promising Start</h3>
        <p>First known as the Roxxon Oil Company, the corporation becomes a major northeastern United States supplier, with a sterling reputation in its industry in the 1940s. However, this proved to be its economic peak, and setbacks in following decades lowers Roxxon’s prominence until its major asset is its brand name alone.

            In recent years, it diversifies into high-tech research and development, aiding in the development of the S.H.I.E.L.D. intelligence agency.</p>

        <h3>Changing Leadership  </h3>
        <p>Roxxon’s high-tech assets catch the eye of corporate financiers, such as Republic Oil and Natural Gas, who wins the bid for it after a lengthy fight. Republic Oil is a relative newcomer on the scene, having been incorporated by crooked Texas oil speculator J.T. Jones. J.T. builds Republic into a valuable corporation, and upon his death, control of the company passed to his son, Hugh Jones.

            Hugh eventually concentrates control of Republic into a small board consisting of himself (as president), Jonas Hale (vice president for research), John Gamelin (vice president for foreign operations) and Simon Krieger (vice president for acquisitions). Thoroughly corrupt, they try to take over several corporations by purchase, blackmail or force, and Roxxon is among their acquisitions. They arrange the murder of Stark Enterprises’ head Howard Stark (and his wife Maria), but Stark’s son Tony, AKA Iron Man, thwarts their Krieger-led takeover of the company his father had built. Following Krieger’s arrest and imprisonment, Jones has him killed in jail and declares a hands-off policy on Stark. Afterward, Republic seeks to build a positive public image, and changes its name to that of one of its subsidiaries, becoming the Roxxon Energy Corporation.</p>

        <h3>Hired Mercs</h3>
        <p>Roxxon is sometimes subject to terrorist attacks by Super Villains such as Viper, AKA Madame Hydra, who controls Jones and all of Roxxon’s subsidiaries. She does so by using the Serpent Crown which puts Jones in contact with the Elder God Set, who provides agents to serve him. The Crown, however, has a mind of its own and has its own ends which sometimes controls Roxxon, and its leader Jones. Several heroes help remove the Crown, leaving Jones in a catatonic state. The Avengers and the U.S. government also go up against Roxxon and its subsidiaries when their work harms people.

            Often though, Roxxon, being the evil corporation that it is, covers up its major disasters to protect itself. Roxxon also takes out its competition by employing hired mercenaries or using their advanced technology and sending them to other dimensions, such as the U.S. government’s Project: PEGASUS.</p>
